# Frontend Documentation for Job Portal

## Overview

The frontend of the Job Portal is a highly responsive and interactive user interface built using ReactJS. It offers a seamless user experience with modern design principles, intuitive navigation, and flexible functionality tailored to both job seekers and administrators. The user interface is powered by Material-UI (MUI), providing a sleek and modern design with support for both Dark and Light themes, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing experience regardless of user preference.

The frontend interacts with the backend APIs, fetching data related to job listings, user profiles, and job applications, while also handling user authentication securely. The system uses Formik and Yup for efficient form handling and validation, making it easy for users to register, log in, and apply for jobs.

## Key Features of the Frontend

### 1. Dark & Light Theme Mode with MUI
- Users can toggle between Dark and Light themes, powered by Material-UI (MUI). The themes are applied globally, providing a consistent user experience across all pages.
- MUI’s Theming API allows for easy customization of colors, typography, and components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

### 2. Responsive Design
- The frontend is built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring the portal looks great on all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
- MUI Grid system and CSS Flexbox are used extensively to ensure layout consistency across screen sizes, making the platform highly accessible and user-friendly.

### 3. High Order Component (HOC) Usage
- High Order Components (HOCs) are utilized to handle repetitive tasks like authentication checks, theming, and routing, which makes the codebase more modular and reusable.
- This improves the scalability and maintainability of the frontend code.

### 4. Admin & User Dashboards
- The User Dashboard allows job seekers to track their job applications, view their job history, and manage their account settings.
- The Admin Dashboard provides an interface for administrators to manage job postings, categories, and view application analytics.
- Both dashboards are powered by MUI components, ensuring a consistent design and user experience.

### 5. Search and Filter Functionality
- Users can search for jobs based on various criteria such as location, category, or keywords. The search results are dynamically fetched from the backend and displayed in a responsive grid layout.
- Filtering options, such as job category and location, are implemented using MUI Dropdowns, providing an easy and intuitive way for users to refine their job searches.

### 6. Paginated Job Listings
- Job listings are paginated to enhance the user experience, ensuring fast load times and reducing the cognitive load of navigating through numerous job posts.
- Material-UI Pagination components are used to provide smooth transitions between job listings, making the navigation of large datasets easy.

### 7. Job Application Page
- Each job listing has its own dedicated Single Job Page, where users can view detailed job descriptions and apply if they are logged in.
- The job application form is powered by Formik, ensuring smooth form state management, and validated with Yup to prevent erroneous data submissions.

### 8. Login & Registration Forms
- The login and registration forms are implemented with Formik and validated using Yup, ensuring that the data entered by users is accurate and secure.
- Error messages are displayed in real-time, enhancing the user experience by guiding them through the registration or login process smoothly.
- The form design follows Material-UI principles, ensuring consistency across all input fields, buttons, and error messages.

### 9. Toast Notifications
- The frontend includes Toast notifications to provide real-time feedback for actions like job applications, form submissions, and authentication.
- These notifications improve the overall user experience by making the system more interactive and informative.

## Tools & Libraries Used

### 1. ReactJS
- The core of the frontend is built using ReactJS, a powerful library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- React’s component-based architecture allows for reusable, modular components that make development faster and code easier to maintain.

### 2. Material-UI (MUI)
- Material-UI (MUI) is used to implement the design system, ensuring that the frontend follows modern design principles while maintaining consistency across components.
- MUI’s theming and styling solution allows for easy customization, providing users with a visually pleasing and responsive experience.

### 3. Formik & Yup
- Formik is used for managing form state in the login, registration, and job application pages, while Yup is employed for form validation to ensure error-free submissions.
- These tools simplify the process of building robust forms with real-time validation and error handling.

### 4. Axios
- Axios is used for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the backend API. It handles all data fetching, including job listings, user authentication, and job applications.

### 5. React Router DOM
- React Router is used for managing the different routes in the application, providing a seamless experience as users navigate through pages like Home, Dashboard, Job Listing, and Single Job pages.

### 6. CSS & Bootstrap
- Custom CSS and Bootstrap are used in conjunction with Material-UI to ensure responsive layouts, especially for custom components that require unique styling outside of Material-UI’s scope.
